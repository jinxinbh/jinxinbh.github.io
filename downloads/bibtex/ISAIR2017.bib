abstract="Image relighting is to change the illumination of an image to a target illumination effect without known the original scene geometry, material information and illumination condition. We propose a novel outdoor scene relighting method, which needs only a single reference image and is based on material constrained layer decomposition. Firstly, the material map is extracted from the input image. Then, the reference image is warped to the input image through patch match based image warping. Lastly, the input image is relighted using material constrained layer decomposition. The experimental results reveal that our method can produce similar illumination effect as that of the reference image on the input image using only a single reference image.",
